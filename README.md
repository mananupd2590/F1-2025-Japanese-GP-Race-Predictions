F1-Race-Outcome-Predictor

Overview

F1-Race-Outcome-Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts Formula 1 race outcomes by integrating historical race data from FastF1, wet-weather performance analysis, and weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API. This project is tailored for data and business analytics, providing actionable insights for predicting upcoming races such as the Japanese GP at Suzuka.

Features
	•	Historical Data Collection: Uses FastF1 to fetch historical race results (e.g., grid positions, finishing positions, driver experience) from multiple seasons.
	•	Wet Performance Analysis: Computes a wet driver score by comparing driver performances in the Canadian GP under dry and wet conditions.
	•	Weather Integration: Fetches weather forecasts (rain probability, temperature, humidity) from OpenWeatherMap to adjust predictions based on race-day conditions.
	•	Machine Learning Model: Trains a weighted RandomForestRegressor model (giving more weight to recent races) to predict finishing positions.
	•	Visualization: Generates charts to display predicted race outcomes for further analysis.

Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/F1-Race-Outcome-Predictor.git
cd F1-Race-Outcome-Predictor


	2.	Install Dependencies:

pip install fastf1 pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn requests


	3.	Configure API Key:
Replace "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY" in the code with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.

Usage
	1.	Run the Script:
Execute the main script to fetch data, train the model, and generate predictions:

python your_script_name.py


	2.	Review Output:
	•	The script prints weather forecasts, wet driver scores, and predicted finishing positions.
	•	Visualizations (bar charts, scatter plots) are saved as PNG files in the project directory.
